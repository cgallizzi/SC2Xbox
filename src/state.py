"""Normalized, output-agnostic gamepad state.

The whole bridge speaks this one intermediate representation:

    physical Steam Controller  ->  GamepadState  ->  virtual Xbox / DS4

Input backends fill a GamepadState in. Output backends read it out. Neither
side needs to know about the other, so adding a controller or an output target
only touches one file.
